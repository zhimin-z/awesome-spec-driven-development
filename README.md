# Awesome Spec-Driven Development with AI Assistants [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome tools for Spec-Driven Development (SDD) - the practice of writing specifications first to guide development, testing, and documentation.

[Spec-Driven Development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) is a methodology where comprehensive specifications are created before implementation begins. This approach ensures better alignment between requirements and delivery, improves code quality, and facilitates better testing and documentation.
